# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Computer Vision

I build intelligent systems that learn, detect, and act â€” combining ML with real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ What I Offer
- Real-time object detection with **YOLO** and **OpenCV**
- Custom ML models for classification, prediction, and automation
- Computer vision for agriculture, security, and UAVs
- End-to-end model training, evaluation, and integration

## ðŸ§  Notable Projects
- **Autonomous UAV:** Built a drone that detects & follows objects using YOLOv3 + OpenCV
- **Sugarcane Node Detection:** Used ML and vision to detect harvesting points in sugarcane images
- **Face Recognition System:** Created a secure identity check system using OpenCV and facial embeddings

## ðŸ›  Tools & Stack
Python | YOLO | OpenCV | Scikit-learn | TensorFlow | Keras | NumPy | Flask

## âœ… Why Me?
- Real-world, tested solutions across robotics, agriculture, and security
- Experience in both model development and system integration
- Focus on efficiency, accuracy, and deployable results

Letâ€™s turn your vision into intelligent action.
